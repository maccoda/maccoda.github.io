<p>This work stemmed from the article written on <a href="https://www.vandenoever.info/blog/2017/02/17/a-simple-rust-gui-with-qml.html">A Simple Rust GUI with QML</a>
 and reused a bit of the back end there.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-relm"> What is Relm</h2>
<p>Recently the GUI library <a href="http://relm.ml/relm-intro">Relm</a>
 came onto the scene with the goal to develop asynchronous GUI applications in Rust. The link provides a great description as to it benefits that it brings so I won't bore you with the details a second time around. In short what really sold me initially (as someone quite unfamiliar with GUI work) was:</p>
<ul><li>The ability to have a declarative nature in which you could define your view</li>
<li>The simplicity with dealing with a model</li>
<li>The simplicity of defining the events or messages received</li>
</ul>
<p>Of this the biggest winner for me was the abstraction of the model manipulation as I wanted to try a few different frameworks so I could have a go to when writing GUI programs and the difficultly was handling the mutability of your model. This is notion is put in the limelight with Rust due to its borrow checker. However I do want to point out that this is by no means a shortcoming of Rust but rather highlights one of the more common issues in UI and all development is a mutable state which is able to altered from several locations. Anyway Rust fanfare aside, Relm has done a great job in wrapping this complexity to make a very simple library to work with I believe.</p>
<h2 id="getting-our-hands-dirty"> Getting our hands dirty</h2>
<p>Relm is quite well documented and has several examples that were easy to follow so again I won't repeat these but it was very easy to get a basic example of a button that is able to report when it is clicked an increment a counter.</p>
<p>One thing I do want to add before we go deeper is that Relm is strongly related to GTK concepts, in particular the widget elements used are GTK widgets. So I would really recommend having at least a reference to it open when working through it if you aren't familiar with the nomenclature of the widgets.</p>
<p>So my test was to see how simple it would be to get the basic file explorer example shown in <a href="https://www.vandenoever.info/blog/2017/02/17/a-simple-rust-gui-with-qml.html">the QML article</a>
 using Relm. To my surprise I managed to get it done in under 200 line (199 to be exact XD). If all you want is to have a look at the code and play around with it (be warned I wouldn't say it is beautiful just yet) I have made a <a href="https://gist.github.com/maccoda/a93fb2a0ef1f283bc63a4be9e5f8fe9c">gist</a>
, otherwise if you'd like to stick around we can build it up bit by bit.</p>
