    <h1 class="post-title">Managing Local Heroku Deployments</h1>
    <span class="post-date">2019-03-11 - 2 mins read</span>
    <p>Recently I have using <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> a fair bit on a hobby project I am working on and
having a hard time getting comfortable with local deployments. As my project is
starting to get a little more complex and actually useful I am wanting to make
sure what I have deployed is something that works. Further to it I have a back end
deployed separately from the front end application so I want to make sure they
are in sync.</p>
<p>All of this lands me at a point where I would love to build in a proper CI/CD
pipeline for these projects, however I struggle to bring myself to it as I am
lazy and couldn't find a short solution in the first 3.5 seconds
:stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:. So I went for the next best thing, an
over-engineered script that gives me some certainty in what I am releasing. This
is what I wanted to share so hopefully someone who gets into the same position
as myself has something pre-made for them.</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" class="language-bash "><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">#!&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;env bash
set -e

echo &quot;Last release:&quot;
cat .last-release
echo
stats=$(git status --porcelain)
if [[ -z $stats ]]; then
    echo &quot;Hit enter to continue with the release&quot;
    read
else
    echo &quot;Workspace is dirty, stash or commit before release!&quot;
    exit 1
fi

.&#x2F;ci.sh
git push heroku master

git log -n 1 &gt; .last-release
git commit -a -m &quot;$(heroku releases -n 1)&quot;
git push
</code></pre>
<p>It isn't by any means a replacement for a proper pipeline but it helped me feel
better about my releases.</p>
<p>Essentially all it is doing is ensuring that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You only release with a clean workspace. All changes you are running locally
are deployed</li>
<li>You can see what was last released by tracking the file</li>
<li>A commit is only deployed if it passes the <code>ci.sh</code> script which for me usually
contains running tests and linter</li>
<li>A commit is also made containing the Heroku version that has been deployed</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope you may find this useful. Any ideas or improvements let me know!</p>
