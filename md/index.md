# Maccoda Mail

A blog covering some of my hopefully more interesting endeavors through software
and in particular Rust.

As a side note, this site it getting generated by a [little tool][made-up] I
made in Rust, before I discovered [Jekyll](jekyll), so goal is now to improve it
so that it can build off the work already put into that project (particularly
themes).

## [Making my first GUI in Relm](relm_gui.html)
Relm is a GUI framework built off GTK and looked like a great candidate for my
first Rust GUI program.

This site is using the [slate][slate] theme for Jekyll
