# Maccoda Mail

A blog covering some of my hopefully more interesting endeavors through software
and in particular Rust.

As a side note, this site it getting generated by a [little tool][made-up] I
made in Rust, before I discovered [Jekyll](jekyll), so goal is now to improve it
so that it can build off the work already put into that project (particularly
themes).

## [Making my first GUI in Relm](relm_gui.html)

Relm is a GUI framework built off GTK and looked like a great candidate for my
first Rust GUI program.

----
## [Cross Compiling Rust](cross_compilation.html)

Looking into how to compile Windows binaries on a Linux machine for Rust.

----
## [Binding Raspberry Pi Libraries](rust_raspberrypi.html)

Tackling two main areas that Rust has greatly simplified. Binding to C/C++ libraries and cross compiling for embedded systems (or not too embedded in terms of the Raspberry Pi)

----
## [Rust Documentation Reference](documentation.html)

A very simple reference to help those wishing to add to the Rust documentation
or for the documentation of your own crates.

This site is using the [slate][slate] theme for Jekyll
