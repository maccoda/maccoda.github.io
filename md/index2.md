# Maccoda Mail

A blog covering some of my hopefully more interesting endeavors through software
and in particular Rust.

As a side note, this site it getting generated by a [little tool][made-up] I
made in Rust, before I discovered [Jekyll](jekyll), so goal is now to improve it
so that it can build off the work already put into that project (particularly
themes).
