    <h1 class="post-title">Note Taking in Visual Studio Code</h1>
    <span class="post-date">2018-04-04 - 4 mins read</span>
    <p>tl;dr Installed some extensions and made some snippets to make a really nice
note taking experience. Exact changes needed are <a href="https://maccoda.github.io/note-taking/#setting-it-all-up">below</a>.</p>
<h2 id="visual-studio-code">Visual Studio Code</h2>
<p>First and foremost I would like to introduce <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> if you haven't
heard of it yet. It is my editor of choice and is very flexible and extendable.
For more information on it check out their site, I definitely recommend having a
look!</p>
<p>Now that you have VSCode I want to share the set of extensions, snippets, etc.
that I put together to create what I believe to be a very useful setup to allow
you to use VSCode for note taking. In particular I prefer to take my notes in
Markdown, if this isn't your preferred I hope I can still assist in some way.</p>
<p>One thing I have noticed is that my laptop consistently starts getting filled up
with more and more applications during my work with software. An IDE (usually a
few even), an editor, database visualizer, email client, internet browsers
(multiple), etc. The last thing I want to do is add another application where I
could use an existing one in its place, this is what triggered me to look into
what alternatives were out there. Considering I am pretty mainstream with my
Markdown note taking it wasn't too much of a difficult task. I already used
VSCode for many of my projects and plenty for editing READMEs and the like, so I
knew that it had quite an expansive set of functionality baked in to provide a
great experience when writing Markdown.</p>
<h2 id="dedicated-note-taking-applications">Dedicated Note Taking Applications</h2>
<p>Before I started this I definitely had a look at existing applications because,
hey who doesn't want to just take something off the shelf and it just works.
Again I specifically looked at the areas around Markdown based note taking and I
noted a few things that I found to be the most useful.</p>
<ol>
<li>Instant preview - a lot of these was in a side by side view</li>
<li>Tags - This is a great feature and easy way of searching and grouping notes</li>
<li>'Notebooks' - Being able to separate the notes into 'notebooks' is a very
logical thing to be able to group notes together for easy reference.</li>
<li>Direct access - not so much a functionality of the application itself but I
enjoy being able to have direct access to my notes and be able to treat them
as their own separate entity.</li>
</ol>
<p>After some tinkering and searching I was very excited to find that I could
create a very similar experience in my already existing VSCode.</p>
<h2 id="setting-it-all-up">Setting it all up</h2>
<h3 id="vsnotes">VSNotes</h3>
<p>Extensions are the name given to plugins for VSCode. They are easily installed
from the extension manager in the sidebar, or even through the command palette
directly!</p>
<p>The first extension you will want is <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=patricklee.vsnotes">VSNotes</a>. This provides the majority of
the functionality. It provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct access to your notes through the <em>Explorer</em> side bar or <em>Command
Palette</em></li>
<li>Tags using the Markdown front matter of your notes</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="settings">Settings</h4>
<p>All that you need to do to make the most of this change the setting for the home
directory of your notes:</p>
<pre data-lang="json" class="language-json "><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">&quot;vsnotes.defaultNotePath&quot;: &quot;&#x2F;path&#x2F;to&#x2F;notes&quot;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="snippets">Snippets</h4>
<p>Then create the following snippet for Markdown files. This snippet can be
created by accessing the <em>Command Palette</em> then selecting <code>Preferences: Configure User Snippets</code> &gt; <code>markdown</code>. This will allow you to create language
specific snippets for Markdown.</p>
<pre data-lang="json" class="language-json "><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">&quot;Front Matter Tags&quot;: {
		&quot;prefix&quot;: &quot;tags&quot;,
		&quot;body&quot;: [
			&quot;---&quot;,
			&quot;tags:&quot;,
			&quot;    - $1&quot;,
			&quot;---&quot;
		]
	}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="auto-preview">Auto Preview</h3>
<p>The final extension was <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hnw.vscode-auto-open-markdown-preview">Auto-Open Markdown Preview</a> which simply
does exactly as the name suggests. When a Markdown file is opened it
automatically opens the side preview of the Markdown file (which I usually can
open from <code>ctrl + shift + m</code>).</p>
<h3 id="notebooks">Notebooks</h3>
<p>The last part is the least inventive of how to address the final point of
notebooks. I am simply using directory structure to solve this problem. However
I am finding that this is sufficient thanks to the structure preview provided by
<strong>VSNotes</strong>. I know I am sorry a not so exciting note to end on but a simple
one.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>All in all I am finding this to be a suitable solution for my note taking
problem and hope this helps someone. I am also keen to hear if anyone else has a
better way of doing this or the like. Probably best way to discuss is to raise
an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/maccoda/maccoda.github.io/issues">repo</a>.</p>
