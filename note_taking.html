</ul><p>tl;dr Installed some extensions and made some snippets to make a really nice note taking experience. Exact changes needed are <a href="#setting-it-all-up">below</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="visual-studio-code"> Visual Studio Code</h2>
<p>First and foremost I would like to introduce <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a>
 if you haven't heard of it yet. It is my editor of choice and is very flexible and extendable. For more information on it check out their site, I definitely recommend having a look!</p>
<p>Now that you have VSCode I want to share the set of extensions, snippets, etc. that I put together to create what I believe to be a very useful setup to allow you to use VSCode for note taking. In particular I prefer to take my notes in Markdown, if this isn't your preferred I hope I can still assist in some way.</p>
<p>One thing I have noticed is that my laptop consistently starts getting filled up with more and more applications during my work with software. An IDE (usually a few even), an editor, database visualizer, email client, internet browsers (multiple), etc. The last thing I want to do is add another application where I could use an existing one in its place, this is what triggered me to look into what alternatives were out there. Considering I am pretty mainstream with my Markdown note taking it wasn't too much of a difficult task. I already used VSCode for many of my projects and plenty for editing READMEs and the like, so I knew that it had quite an expansive set of functionality baked in to provide a great experience when writing Markdown.</p>
<h2 id="dedicated-note-taking-applications"> Dedicated Note Taking Applications</h2>
<p>Before I started this I definitely had a look at existing applications because, hey who doesn't want to just take something off the shelf and it just works. Again I specifically looked at the areas around Markdown based note taking and I noted a few things that I found to be the most useful.</p>
<ol><li>Instant preview - a lot of these was in a side by side view</li>
<li>Tags - This is a great feature and easy way of searching and grouping notes</li>
<li>'Notebooks' - Being able to separate the notes into 'notebooks' is a very logical thing to be able to group notes together for easy reference.</li>
<li>Direct access - not so much a functionality of the application itself but I enjoy being able to have direct access to my notes and be able to treat them as their own separate entity.</li>
</ol><p>After some tinkering and searching I was very excited to find that I could create a very similar experience in my already existing VSCode.</p>
<h2 id="setting-it-all-up"> Setting it all up</h2>
<h3 id="vsnotes"> VSNotes</h3>
<p>Extensions are the name given to plugins for VSCode. They are easily installed from the extension manager in the sidebar, or even through the command palette directly!</p>
<p>The first extension you will want is <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=patricklee.vsnotes">VSNotes</a>
. This provides the majority of the functionality. It provides:</p>
<ul><li>Direct access to your notes through the <em>Explorer</em>
 side bar or <em>Command Palette</em>
</li>
<li>Tags using the Markdown front matter of your notes</li>
</ul><h4 id="settings"> Settings</h4>
<p>All that you need to do to make the most of this change the setting for the home directory of your notes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">"vsnotes.defaultNotePath": "/path/to/notes"
</code></pre>
<h4 id="snippets"> Snippets</h4>
<p>Then create the following snippet for Markdown files. This snippet can be created by accessing the <em>Command Palette</em>
 then selecting <code>Preferences: Configure User Snippets</code>
 > <code>markdown</code>
. This will allow you to create language specific snippets for Markdown.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">"Front Matter Tags": {
        "prefix": "tags",
        "body": [
            "---",
            "tags:",
            "    - $1",
            "---"
        ]
    }
</code></pre>
<h3 id="auto-preview"> Auto Preview</h3>
<p>The final extension was <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hnw.vscode-auto-open-markdown-preview">Auto-Open Markdown Preview</a>
 which simply does exactly as the name suggests. When a Markdown file is opened it automatically opens the side preview of the Markdown file (which I usually can open from <code>ctrl + shift + m</code>
).</p>
<h3 id="notebooks"> Notebooks</h3>
<p>The last part is the least inventive of how to address the final point of notebooks. I am simply using directory structure to solve this problem. However I am finding that this is sufficient thanks to the structure preview provided by <b>VSNotes</b>
. I know I am sorry a not so exciting note to end on but a simple one.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"> Conclusion</h2>
<p>All in all I am finding this to be a suitable solution for my note taking problem and hope this helps someone. I am also keen to hear if anyone else has a better way of doing this or the like. Probably best way to discuss is to raise an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/maccoda/maccoda.github.io/issues">repo</a>
