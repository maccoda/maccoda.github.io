            <h1 id="writing-rust-documentation"> Writing Rust Documentation</h1>
<p>Personally I have found Rust documentation to be great and very easy to follow. Further I really enjoy that I can easily access the source code from the documentation.</p>
<p>Recently I have tried to contribute back through writing some documentation on the standard library and thought I would try construct a reference for guidelines and principles the docs team seem to be following.</p>
<h2 id="formatting"> Formatting</h2>
<ul><li>Wrap lines to 80 characters</li>
<li>Leave room for headings to breathe, empty line above and below.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="templates"> Templates</h2>
<p>Standardization is always good in the standard library so to address these the documentation team developed some templates for common documentation which makes the feel of the documentation very consistent and easy to write.</p>
<h3 id="iterator-template"> Iterator Template</h3>
<p>When describing a struct that implements <code>Iterator</code>
 the following template should be used:</p>
<blockquote><p>An iterator that {what it does}</p>
<p>This struct is create by the {foo} method[ on {trait}]. See its documentation for more.</p>
</blockquote><h2 id="linking"> Linking</h2>
<p>This was the part I continue to struggle with as it is a bit confusing without a reference nearby.</p>
<h3 id="modules"> Modules</h3>
<p>Each module is located in its own sub-directory. That is if my crate is called <code>foo</code>
 with a public module <code>bar</code>
. Then to reference something in that module my comment link would need to be something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">/// [bar::MyStruct`]: bar/struct.MyStruct.html
</code></pre>
<h3 id="lexical-elements"> Lexical Elements</h3>
<h4 id="structs"> Structs</h4>
<p>All structs will be prepended with <code>struct</code>
 such as <code>struct.MyStruct.html</code>
 and will be located on their own HTML page.</p>
<h4 id="enums"> Enums</h4>
<p>All enums will be prepended with <code>enum</code>
 such as <code>enum.MyEnum.html</code>
 and will be located on their own HTML page.</p>
<h4 id="traits"> Traits</h4>
<p>All traits will be prepended with <code>trait</code>
 such as <code>trait.MyTrait.html</code>
 and will be located on their own HTML page.</p>
<h4 id="functions"> Functions</h4>
<p>Functions will always be related to some struct, trait or enum, hence will not have their own HTML page and need to be referenced by ID. So let's say I have a function called <code>my_func</code>
 for a struct called <code>MyStruct</code>
 (I know pretty original over here), then to reference this would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">/// [`my_func`]: MyStruct.html#method.my_func
</code></pre>
<p>However if you were wishing to reference a function on a trait it would be slightly different.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">/// [`my_func`]: MyTrait.html#tymethod.my_func
</code></pre>
